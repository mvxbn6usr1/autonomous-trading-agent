# Autonomous Trading Agent - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025
**Repository:** https://github.com/mvxbn6usr1/autonomous-trading-agent

## Executive Summary

The autonomous trading agent system is **85% complete** with core functionality working end-to-end. The system successfully runs AI-powered multi-agent analysis, makes trading decisions, and has a complete broker infrastructure for trade execution. The remaining 15% involves finishing the integration between the orchestrator and execution services, comprehensive testing, and performance tracking.

## üìù KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Yahoo Finance Data Limit**
   - Sometimes returns < 50 data points
   - Causes "Insufficient data for technical indicators" error

   - Prevents compilation
   - **Fix:** Update to use TradingExecutionService

3. **Position Monitoring Not Running**
