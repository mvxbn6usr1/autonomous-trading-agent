## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Run Backtest
```bash
tsx test-backtest.ts
```

### 2. Check PDT Status
```typescript
import { pdtTracker } from './server/services/compliance/pdtTracker';
const status = await pdtTracker.checkPDTStatus(userId, strategyId);
```

### 3. Enable Redis Cache
```bash
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
