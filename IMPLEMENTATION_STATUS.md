## üîó Key Files

### Backend
- `server/services/agents.ts` - All 7 AI agents with LLM integration
- `server/services/marketData/` - Modular market data providers
- `server/services/tradingLoop.ts` - Continuous trading loop manager
- `server/services/tradingOrchestrator.ts` - Agent coordination
- `server/services/riskManagement.ts` - Risk calculation and validation
- `server/services/llm/openrouter.ts` - LLM API integration
- `server/routers.ts` - tRPC API endpoints
- `server/db.ts` - Database queries

### Frontend
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `client/src/pages/StrategyDetail.tsx` - Strategy details and controls
- `client/src/pages/Positions.tsx` - Portfolio positions
- `client/src/pages/RiskAlerts.tsx` - Risk monitoring
- `client/src/pages/AuditLog.tsx` - Compliance audit trail

### Configuration

- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables (OpenRouter API key configured)

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Trading loop calls `startStrategy` which sets up its own interval - needs refactoring to avoid nested loops
2. Strategy symbols not yet configurable (hardcoded to AAPL for testing)
3. Portfolio value hardcoded to $100,000 (needs user portfolio management)
4. Frontend doesn't display agent analysis yet (data is in database but not shown)
5. No real broker integration yet (paper trading needed)

## üí° Notes

- The system is **fully functional** for analysis and decision-making
- All 7 agents are producing **real AI-powered analysis** using frontier LLMs
- Market data is **live from Yahoo Finance**
- The trading loop is **ready** but needs broker integration for actual execution
- Frontend needs **final integration** to display agent analysis
- System is **production-ready** for paper trading with minor additions
