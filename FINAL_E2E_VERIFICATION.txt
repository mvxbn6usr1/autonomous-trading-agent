Final Decision: HOLD
Confidence: 68.0%
Reasoning: "AAPL presents balanced risk-reward at current levels.
           Technical consolidation below 20-day SMA with neutral RSI.
           Fundamentally strong but premium valuation limits upside.
           Both bull and bear cases equally weighted (0.58 each)."
